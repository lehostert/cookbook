## Ingredients

* Gnocchi
   - [ ] 1 lb gnocchi
   - [ ] salt
* Sauce
   - [ ] 4 oz pancetta, diced
   - [ ] 1 cup thinly sliced onion
   - [ ] 2 tablespoons chopped fresh sage
   - [ ] 1/2 cup pumpkin puree
   - [ ] 3/4 cup whole milk or cream
   - [ ] 1/4 cup parmesan cheese, grated
   - [ ] Fresh cracked pepper

## Directions

Estimated total time: 35 minutes

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
Add the gnocchi to the pot and boil 2-3 minutes, or until the gnocchi float to the surface.
Drain and set aside.
2. In the meantime, heat a skillet over medium.
Add the pancetta and cook about 10 minutes, until the fat has rendered and the pancetta is crispy.
Remove from the skillet and place on a paper towel-lined plate.
3. Drain excess fat, if needed, leaving about 1 tablespoon in the pan.
Add the onion.
Saute for 5 minutes before adding half the sage, then saute 5 minutes more, or until the onions are very soft and beginning to brown in places.
4. Add the pumpkin puree and milk to the skillet and stir until smooth.
Add gnocchi and pancetta to the sauce and simmer until slightly thickened and the gnocchi and pancetta have warmed through.
5. Serve topped with parmesan cheese and fresh cracked pepper.
