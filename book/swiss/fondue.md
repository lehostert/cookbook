# Fondue

Once there is snow on the Jura mountains fondue season can begin.

The types of cheese used should vary according to whatever is the best quality available.
Mixes of Fontina, Gruyère, Comté, Emmental, and Vacherin Mont d'Or have worked well.
The fractions of the total cheese mixture will need to be varied for the types of cheese selected.

## Ingredients

* [ ] 1 lb cheese mixture
   - [ ] 0.46 lb Fontina
   - [ ] 0.18 lb Gruyère
   - [ ] 0.18 lb Emmental
   - [ ] 0.18 lb Comté
* [ ] 250 ml dry white wine
* [ ] 4 cloves garlic
* [ ] 2 teaspoons arrowroot flour
* [ ] 2 teaspoons kirsch
* [ ] 1 tablespoon lemon juice

### Optional but helpful

* [ ] 1 wooden slotted spoon for stirring

## Directions

1. Slice 1 clove of garlic in half and rub the interior of the fondue pot with the cut sides.
2. Mince the cut clove and 3 additional cloves of garlic.
3. Grate the cheeses and combine in a large bowl.
4. Toss the cheese mixture in arrowroot flour.
5. Add the minced garlic and the wine to the fondue pot.
Heat over medium and bring to a simmer.
6. Once the wine is simmering, begin adding cheese slowly in small handfuls while stirring continuously to fully incorporate.
7. Continue stirring until the fondue leaves a skin over the hole in the slotted spoon.
8. Add in lemon juice and kirsch.
    ```{note}
    The lemon juice will help prevent the cheese from clumping and breaking the fondue.
    ```
9. Serve immediately, with a small glass of kirsch.


## Recommended Sides

In addition to the traditional bread, serving with 1 lb of halved and roasted rosemary potatoes for dipping and a roasted bulb of garlic works well.
